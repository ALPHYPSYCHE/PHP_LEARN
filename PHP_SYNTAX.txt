PHP syntax is straightforward, and it closely resembles the syntax of other programming languages. Here are some key aspects of PHP syntax:

1. **Script Tags:**
   - PHP code is typically embedded in HTML or can exist as standalone PHP scripts.
   - PHP code is enclosed within `<?php` and `?>` tags.
   - For standalone PHP files, you can omit the closing `?>` tag to avoid accidental white space or line break issues.

   Example:
   ```php
   <?php
   // PHP code here
   ?>
   ```

2. **Comments:**
   - Single-line comments start with `//` or `#`.
   - Multi-line comments are enclosed between `/*` and `*/`.

   Example:
   ```php
   // This is a single-line comment

   /*
   This is a
   multi-line comment
   */
   ```

3. **Variables:**
   - Variables start with the `$` symbol, followed by the variable name.
   - Variable names are case-sensitive and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores but should start with a letter or underscore.

   Example:
   ```php
   $name = "John";
   $age = 25;
   ```

4. **Data Types:**
   - PHP supports various data types such as strings, integers, floats, booleans, arrays, and more.
   - The data type is dynamically determined based on the assigned value.

   Example:
   ```php
   $stringVar = "Hello, PHP!";
   $intVar = 42;
   $floatVar = 3.14;
   $boolVar = true;
   ```

5. **Operators:**
   - PHP includes various operators for arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical operations, etc.

   Example:
   ```php
   $sum = $a + $b;
   $isGreater = ($a > $b);
   ```

6. **Control Structures:**
   - PHP uses control structures like `if`, `else`, `elseif`, `while`, `for`, `switch`, etc., for flow control.

   Example:
   ```php
   if ($age >= 18) {
       echo "You are an adult.";
   } else {
       echo "You are a minor.";
   }
   ```

7. **Functions:**
   - Functions are declared using the `function` keyword.
   - Function names follow the same rules as variable names.

   Example:
   ```php
   function greet($name) {
       echo "Hello, $name!";
   }

   greet("Alice");
   ```

8. **Arrays:**
   - Arrays can be indexed or associative, and they are created using the `array()` construct.

   Example:
   ```php
   $fruits = array("Apple", "Banana", "Orange");
   $info = array("name" => "John", "age" => 25);
   ```

9. **Strings:**
   - Strings can be declared using single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).
   - Variables within double-quoted strings are interpolated.

   Example:
   ```php
   $greeting = "Hello, $name!";
   ```

These are the fundamental aspects of PHP syntax. As you progress, you'll encounter more advanced features and syntax, such as object-oriented programming, exception handling, namespaces, and more. Practice is crucial for becoming proficient in using PHP syntax effectively.
